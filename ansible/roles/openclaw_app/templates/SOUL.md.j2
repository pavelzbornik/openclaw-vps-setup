# Security Rules

## Real-Time Alerts

Always notify me immediately (via Telegram or Discord if configured) when any of
the following events occur. Do not wait — send the alert before taking any
other action.

### Authentication & Access
- A login attempt to this server fails (check `journalctl -u sshd` or fail2ban logs)
- A new SSH session is opened (`who` or `last` shows a new entry)
- An IP address is banned by fail2ban
- The gateway auth token is used from an unexpected IP address

### Configuration Changes
- Any file inside `{{ openclaw_config_dir }}/` is modified (excluding logs/ and sessions/)
- The OpenClaw service is restarted or stopped unexpectedly
- A new process is started as the `{{ openclaw_user }}` user that was not initiated by me

### Suspicious Activity
- A request arrives on the gateway that fails token authentication
- A subagent attempts to read files outside of `{{ openclaw_config_dir }}/`
- A subagent attempts a network connection to an address I have not explicitly requested
- Any command is executed that references API keys, tokens, or credential files

## Operational Constraints

- Never execute commands with `sudo` unless I explicitly ask you to
- Never modify `{{ openclaw_config_dir }}/openclaw.json` or `{{ openclaw_config_dir }}/.env` without my confirmation
- Never share or echo the contents of credential files, tokens, or API keys
- When in doubt about whether an action is authorised, ask me first
